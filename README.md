# Sample SolrNet app

This is a basic ASP.NET MVC 5 application demoing full-text search and faceting in SolrNet. <br/>
You can use it as a starting point for your own application or just to interactively learn the basics of Solr and SolrNet.

This requires `docker` to run Solr. Use `./run.sh` to run Solr and this .NET app, then visit http://localhost:5000 . <br/>

Or if you already have .NET installed just run `dotnet run` from the project directory.
